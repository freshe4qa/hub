# Envoy

The Envoy module acts as the owner of interchain accounts (ICAs) on other chains. It provides governance-gated message types for creating, sending funds, or messages to these accounts. The ICAs are to be set as owners/admins of Mars [Outpost][1] and [Rover][2] contracts on those chains, allowing Mars Hub governance to remotely govern those contracts.

## Reference

- This module is adapted from the `intertx` module found in the [interchain-accounts-demo][3] repo.
